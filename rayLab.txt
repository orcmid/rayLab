TODO

  * Complete the scaffolding down from here.

  * Complete the .gitattributes and .gitignore for here

  * Complete the manifest

  * Add README warning about breaking raylib changes and focus on raylib 4.

  * Complete the construction structure down to projects/scripts

  * Replicate the build-windows.bat case that worked already and that
    shows the different *.obs produced as fixed static components.

  * Update NOTICE.txt with ways to respect the raylib license
    and those of raylib dependencies.

  * Add attribution boilerplates.

  * Figure out whether wiki renderings handle images without degradations
    as is the case for docs/, but not for the README here.

  * Setup discussion and decide whether or not to use docs/ and/or a wiki
