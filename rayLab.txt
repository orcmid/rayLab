TODO

  * I have not touched this in almost 2 years, spending more energy on
    VCrayApp, C Language materials, and, lately, repurposing my web-site
    materials onto orcmid.github.io along with use of FrontPage once again.
    This is more like myCleanC except focused on raylib.

  * I'm not so thrilled about raylib as I was when I first encountered it.
    I need to consider how to engage in defensive programming and nfoTools-
    style confirmation.  Also, I won't be needing any of this for the Miser
    Project and that needs to become a serious priority once the repurposing
    of web sites is completed.

  * Complete the scaffolding down from here.

  * Complete the .gitattributes and .gitignore for here

  * Add README warning about breaking raylib changes and focus on raylib 4.

  * Complete the construction structure down to projects/scripts

  * Update NOTICE.txt with ways to respect the raylib license
    and those of raylib dependencies.

  * Add attribution boilerplates.

  * Provide structure and additional pages to /docs

  * Repurpose rayLab to be a raylib companion for Native Windows development
    of potentially generic platform aids.

    ** Reflect on all scaffolding (*.txt) files
    ** Reflect on docs/ (*.md) files
    ** Reflect on README.md

  * When the nfoTools setup for VCrayMumbles is achieved, identify and use
    the ones that work here for laboratory purposes.
