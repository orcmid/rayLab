MANIFEST

    raylib/
        pristine clone of the raysan5/raylib/ repository, excluded from
        the orcmid/rayLab repository by .gitignore here.  A clone is used
        when confirming with the latest working master.  For production
        development projects, release Zips are extracted and renamed to
        simply raylib/, if necessary, so that all in-project references are to
        raylib/ regardless of the version installed.

    raylib-3.7.0.zip
        current raylib stable release (absent extras and externals) that
        rayLab experiments are currently performed with (pending availability
        of a raylib 4)

     README.md
         The introduction page viewed automatically at orcmid/rayLab/ on
         GitHub

    LICENSE.txt
         The open-source software license that applies to the entire
         rayLab repository except where stated otherwise.

    NOTICE.txt
         Notice that applies with respect to external resources that
         are incorporated in rayLab, with or without modification.

    .gitattributes
         A declaration of file attributes for use in Git repositories of
         the rayLab source code.

    .gitignore
         A declaration of artifacts to be ignored and excluded from Git
         repositories, applying to working files that are not part of the
         managed archive materials

TODO

  * Complete the scaffolding down from here.

  * Complete the .gitattributes and .gitignore for here

   * Add README warning about breaking raylib changes and focus on raylib 4.

  * Complete the construction structure down to projects/scripts

  * Replicate the build-windows.bat case that worked already and that
    shows the different *.obs produced as fixed static components.

  * Update NOTICE.txt with ways to respect the raylib license
    and those of raylib dependencies.

  * Add attribution boilerplates.

  * Figure out whether wiki renderings handle images without degradations
    as is the case for docs/, but not for the README here.

  * Provide structure and additional pages to /docs

  * Repurpose rayLab to be a raylib companion for Native Windows development

    ** Reflect on all scaffolding (*.txt) files
