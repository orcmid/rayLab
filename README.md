# The raylib Companion for Native Windows Development

The [raysan5/raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) provides a Clean C
library for the development of graphical programs on a variety of computer
platforms using OpenGL for interoperability.

GitHub project [orcmid/rayLab](https://github.com/orcmid/rayLab) is a
companion for demonstration of raylib in simplified development
of native Windows graphical applications, especially graphical games, on the
[nfoTools](https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools) model.

The [rayLab](https://orcmid.github.io/rayLab) HOWTOs and Tutorials on using
raylib and performing its examples provide an on-ramp and guard rails for
novices and others wanting to make use of raylib for its practical simplicity.

## Freely-Available Tools Are Featured

 * git and gitHub for backup and change management
 * Microsoft Visual Studio Build Tools for compiling, testing, and deploying
 raylib-based programs (see [nfoTools T21102](https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/tools/T211002/))
 * Microsoft Visual Studio Code for editing and integrated operation
(see [nfoTools T21101](https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools/tools/T211001/))

## Focus on Windows

Development is assumed to be performed on Windows 10/11 desktop PCs with the
results targetted for the same platforms, potentially distributed via the
Windows Store.  The critical characteristic is reliance on raylib for all
graphical functions.

## Approach

The first step is establishing simple, repeatable  use of VS Build Tools in
demonstrating all of the builds and example exercises in the raylib
repository.  We start with the Native Windows command-line environment before
advancing to more-integrated approaches.

## NItty Gritty

See [rayLab documentation](https://orcmid.github.io/rayLab/) for
specific details.  There's general reliance on
[nfoTools](https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools) for prerequisites.  There is
also rayLab-specific
[scaffolding here on GitHub](https://github.com/orcmid/rayLab/blob/main/rayLab.txt).
