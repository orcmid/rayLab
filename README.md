# rayLab

GitHub project orcmid/rayLab is a laboratory for experimental adaptation of
GitHub [raysan5/raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) libraries for
native Windows desktop PC applications, especially graphical games.

Freely-available tools are featured:

 * git and gitHub for backup and change management
 * Microsoft Visual Studio Build Tools for compiling, testing, and deploying
 * Microsoft Visual Studio Code for editing and integrated operation

Development is assumed to be performed on Windows 10/11 desktop PCs with the
results targetted for the same platforms, potentially distributed via the
Windows Store.  The critical characteristic is reliance on raylib for all
graphical functions.

rayLab shadows raysan5/raylib, mimicking that structure in the location of
lab experiments.  Experimental customizations and expansions of raylib
materials are at corresponding shadow locations.  Any contributions back
to raylib will happen via a [raylib fork](https://github.com/orcmid/raylib).

The first step is to establish simple use of VS Build Tools in conducting
all of the builds and example exercises in the raylib repository.

See [rayLab documentation](https://orcmid.github.io/rayLab/) for any
specific details.  There's general reliance on
[nfoTools](https://orcmid.github.io/nfoTools) for prerequisites.  There is
also rayLab-specific
[scaffolding here on GitHub](https://github.com/orcmid/rayLab/blob/master/rayLab.txt).
