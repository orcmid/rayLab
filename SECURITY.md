## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please confine vulnerability reporting Orcmid on GitHub projects that have supported releases.  If you believe there is still need to engage in
private discussion about a potential threat or threat-surface defect here on rayLab, please use the GitHub
vulerability reporting provision of this project's Security tab.

If you are unable to exercise that capability, or prefer private email communication, send a digitally-signed plaintext email to 
[orcmid](mailto:orcmid@msn.com).

If you have additional concerns about email security/privacy, put your message in an ASCII-armored file PGP-encrypted enclosure using the
[orcmid Apache](https://people.apache.org/keys/committer/orcmid.asc) public key.
