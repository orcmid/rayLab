Pull-requests are unwarranted.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please confine vulnerability reporting to Orcmid on GitHub projects that have
supported releases.

To privately report an exploitable vulnerability or exposed threat-surface
that pertains to rayLab, however unlikely, use the GitHub vulnerability
reporting provision of the
[Adv10 Security](https://github.com/orcmid/rayLab/security) tab.

If you are unable to exercise that capability, or prefer private email
communication, send a digitally-signed plaintext email to
[orcmid](mailto:orcmid@msn.com).

If you have reservations about email security/privacy, enclose an
ASCII-armored file PGP-encrypted using the
[orcmid Apache](https://people.apache.org/keys/committer/orcmid.asc)
public key.

Finally, if you wish encrypted responses, sign that message before
encryption in order for your public key to be available for that purpose.
