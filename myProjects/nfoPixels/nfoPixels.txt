            EXPLORATION OF RAYLAB USAGE IN NATIVE WINDOWS APPS

                    nfoPixels Graphical Display Normalizer
                    --------------------------------------

    nfoPixels consists of a header file and one or more implementation
    files for reporting and adjusting to the characteristics of raster
    displays.  Operations are in terms of pixel coordinates in standard
    graphical form: X and Y both increasing with (0,0) in the upper left
    corner in the viewer's perspective.

    nfoPixels is based, as is raylib, on the "standard" DPI being taken as
    96 for Windows and 72 for Apple.  There is some possible trickery though
    (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_per_inch#Computer_monitor_DPI_standards).

    For every platform, the scaling business needs to be addressed in a way
    that has desktop builds of the same program produce visually-comparable
    display results when operated on computers with different displays.

    The architecture of nfoPixels allows for customization to support more
    platforms by additions, preserving the API as portable.  The base
    implementation is specific to Windows desktop applications because I have
    no means to support other cases.

    nfoPixels will be included in the VCrayApp cache for employment in
    VCrayConfirm compilations, demonstrating its effectiveness for VCrayApp
    projects.

    AVOIDING MISSION CREEP: It is important to have a confirmed understanding
    of the Microsoft Windows cases for execution on Windows 7 and later.  The
    compilations are expected to all be for x64 versions of Windows and the
    basic raylib compilation scheme for single-monitor applications is the
    scope.  There is no intention to support multiple monitors, changes in
    DPI, and so on.  We are confining ourselves to the elementary world in
    which BGI was established, adjusting to modern platforms but not going
    crazy for all of the variations in operation that are now possible.

    THAT HAVING BEEN SAID: This is the 1.0 scoping.  It is important to learn
    about more-advanced situations and see what might be done for them.  It
    is not urgent and the 1.0 API will be rigorously preserved.  We only have
    this because we do need to want apps to appear properly when installed on
    computers having varying display characteristics that impact the usability
    of the raylib app.

    ABOUT SCREEN CAPTURES.  What is to be understood about the different
    screen captures is difficult to understand if the DPI and scaling are not
    reflected.

    This demonstrates the two Scaled images adjusted so they appear at the
    same DPI, whatever resolution this is viewed at.  Notice that scaling is
    done by Windows for GUI elements, but for raster images created using
    fixed dimensions in pixels there is no automatic-scaling to adjust for
    differences in display resolution and any user-selected GUI scaling.  The
    200dpi image does show that the GUI elements of the frame, such as the
    title bar, are scaled.  That doesn't happen for some apps.

TODO

 * Research the Win32 libraries and discern the discoverable features going
   back to at least Windows 7.  This will be documented in Win32-display.txt

 * Accessibility is related although different.  This might be an nfoAccess
   matter.
