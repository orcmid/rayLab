            EXPLORATION OF RAYLAB USAGE IN NATIVE WINDOWS APPS

                        SHADOWED RAYLIB PROJECTS FOLDER
                        -------------------------------

    The raylib/projects consist of various ways to build raylib-dependent
    projects.

    The comparable rayLab/projects are designed to fit in a way that can
    be incorporated in projects that are in shadow structures or inserted
    directly into a working copy of raylib.

    Further details will depend on exactly how that works out.

TODO

  * Replicate the build-windows.bat case that worked already and that
    shows the different *.obs produced as fixed static components.

  * Figure out how to build and exercise the raylib examples using a couple
    of WinCon-like build setups.

  * Determine whether there is a way that inserting projects into a working
    copy of raylib or in a shadow structure can work the same regardless.
    This tends to mean that relative links into raylib for includes and
    other artifacts will work properly.

  * raylib/examples are in subgroups and the code in them makes reference to
    resources that are in a subfolder of the folder having the example. This
    has to be taken into account when the compiled executables run.  One way
    would be to always copy the resources/ folder into the folder having the
    compiled executable.

  * We don't want the .obj files and other intermediates in the same location
    as the compiled .exe.  We want the .exe be in a folder of its own along
    with any copied resources.

  * We need to sneak up on this.  Start with simple cases and refine what
    works as we go.
