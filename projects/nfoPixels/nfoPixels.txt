            EXPLORATION OF RAYLAB USAGE IN NATIVE WINDOWS APPS

                    nfoPixels Graphical Display Normalizer
                    --------------------------------------

    nfoPixels consists of a header file and one or more implementation
    files for reporting and adjusting to the characteristics of raster
    displays.  Operations are in terms of pixel coordinates in standard
    graphical form: X and Y both increasing with (0,0) in the upper left
    corner in the viewer's perspective.

    nfoPixels is based, as is raylib, on the "standard" DPI being taken as
    96 for Windows and 72 for Apple.  There is some possible trickery though
    (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dots_per_inch#Computer_monitor_DPI_standards).

    For every platform, the scaling business needs to be addressed in a way
    that has desktop builds of the same program produce visually-comparable
    display results.

    The architecture of nfoPixels allows for customization to support more
    platforms by additions, preserving the API as portable.  The base
    implementation is specific to Windows desktop applications because I have
    no means to support other cases.

    nfoPixels will be included in the VCrayApp cache for employment in
    VCrayConfirm compilations, demonstrating its effectiveness for VCrayApp
    projects.

TODO

 * Research the Win32 libraries and discern the discoverable features going
   back to at least Windows 7.  This will be documented in Win32-display.txt

 * Accessibility is related although different.  This might be an nfoAccess
   matter.
