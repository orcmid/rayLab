            EXPLORATION OF RAYLAB USAGE IN NATIVE WINDOWS APPS

                            RAYLAB PROJECTS FOLDER
                            ----------------------

    The rayLab/projects consist of various ways to build raylib-dependent
    projects, focused on desktop builds using VC/C++ for Windows.

    The rayLab/projects are designed to provide utilities and experiments
    related to raylib in a form that can be replicated/adapted by other users.

MANIFEST

    myProjects.txt
        this manifest and job-jar file

    nfoPixels/
        "plug-in" utility function to provide valuable information and
        adjustments for the size and scaling of graphical-display operations
        in pixel units and standard graphical display coordinates (X and Y
        both increasing from 0,0).


    raylib/
        pristine clone of the raysan5/raylib/ repository, excluded from
        the orcmid/rayLab repository by .gitignore here.  A clone is used
        when confirming with the latest working master.  For production
        development projects, release Zips are extracted and renamed to
        simply raylib/, if necessary, so that all in-project references are to
        raylib/ regardless of the version installed.  This placement favors
        the use of VCrayApp neighbors of the raylib/ folder.

    scripts/
        development of reusable script cases using VC build environment
        (obsolete)
