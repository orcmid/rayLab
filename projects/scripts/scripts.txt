            EXPLORATION OF RAYLAB USAGE IN NATIVE WINDOWS APPS

                      EXPERIMENTAL RAYLIB SCRIPT CASES
                      --------------------------------

    The raylib/projects/scripts/ folder contains a variety of scripts that
    demonstrate compiling for a variety of platforms and toolcrafts.

    This rayLab/projects/scripts is for a variety of comparable script
    *folders* that work within a project that includes a working copy
    of raylib in the manner incorporated in the rayLab project.

    Several iterations are made to get to something with the quality of WinCon
    and is as easily customized, maybe as WinRay.

TODO

  * Replicate the build-windows.bat case that worked already and that
    shows the different *.obs produced as fixed static components.

  * Figure out how to build and exercise the raylib examples using a couple
    of WinCon-like build setups.

  * Determine whether there is a way that inserting projects into a working
    copy of raylib or in a shadow structure can work the same regardless.
    This tends to mean that relative links into raylib for includes and
    other artifacts will work properly.

  * raylib/examples are in subgroups and the code in them makes reference to
    resources that are in a subfolder of the folder having the example. This
    has to be taken into account when the compiled executables run.  One way
    would be to always copy the resources/ folder into the folder having the
    compiled executable.

  * We don't want the .obj files and other intermediates in the same location
    as the compiled .exe.  We want the .exe be in a folder of its own along
    with any copied resources.

  * We need to sneak up on this.  Start with simple cases and refine what
    works as we go.

  * Take the raylib/scripts/build-windows.bat and core_basic_windows.c down
    a level to a raw case.
