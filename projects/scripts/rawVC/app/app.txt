            EXPLORATION OF RAYLAB USAGE IN NATIVE WINDOWS APPS

                          RAWvc XCOPY APP FOLDER
                          ----------------------

    The raylib/projects/scripts/rawVC/app/ folder is a standard subfolder for
    a command-line build in the parent (e.g., rawCL) folder.  app/ contents
    consist of the compiled .exe and any companion files/folders that are
    required for usage of the executable program.

    Although the materials may be persistent, they are also excluded from any
    git repository, since they are not part of a contribution to any clone
    in which app/ is part of a construction set such as rawVC.

    The folder is amenable to XCopy deployment, or potential use in creating
    an MSIX distributable.  The app/ folder should be amenable to Zipping up,
    possibly after renaming the app.exe, and removing some scaffolding
    files.  Addition of a README and other user-supporting materials would be
    handy.

MANIFEST

    app.txt
        this manifest and job-jar file
    .gitignore
        excluding user-specific compilations from a cloned repository

TODO

  * Confirm that executable can be created when compilation is in a sister
    folder.  Something like /Fe..\app\app.exe

  * Determine what the context of options and command line parameters is
    (more under wrk.txt and also toolcraft)

  * Add a NOTICE.txt that acknowledges development and construction.
