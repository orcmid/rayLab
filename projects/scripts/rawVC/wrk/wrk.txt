            EXPLORATION OF RAYLAB USAGE IN NATIVE WINDOWS APPS

                         RAWVC SKELETON WRK FOLDER
                         -------------------------

    The raylib/projects/scripts/RAWVC/wrk/ folder is a standard subfolder for
    a command-line build with all of its intermediates and customizable
    parameters.

    The folder will contain intermediate results of compile activities.  These
    are not required after the build and can easily be reconstructed in a
    subsequent build.

    There are some additional files that are excluded from repositories when
    loaded from a kit.  These are locally customizable and not intended to
    be committed to the origin repository when pulled from kits.

MANIFEST

    wrk.txt
        this manifest and job-jar file
    .gitignore
        excluding compilation intermediates from any git repository

TODO

  * If compiling is done here, the question is whether the option files can
    be accessed at rawVC from down here.  And then what are relative links
    determined from.  Note: They are incorporated literally prior to
    processing the resulting command line, so relative to wrk/.

  * We need VC Toolcraft (in nfoTools) on CL.exe and especially the options
    files and how things like batch/environment variables and relative links
    are resolved.

  * Maybe options need to be copied or unzipped to tmp/ to have their
    customization ignored.  This doesn't quite make sense for rayLab; but it
    is a devKit case if contributed to raylib.  Hmm.

  * Juggle having the least that could possibly work here.
