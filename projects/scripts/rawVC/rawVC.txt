            EXPLORATION OF RAYLAB USAGE IN NATIVE WINDOWS APPS

                      RAWCL BARE-BONES VC COMPILE SETUP
                      ---------------------------------

    The raylib/projects/scripts/rawCL folder is for a tear-down of the raylib
    build-windows.bat to a minimum case that works in a Command Prompt
    command-line environment that is already established.

    Operation is confirmed and the skeletal arrangement is employed with
    some simple example cases.

    The goal is to boil this down to one using *.opt options and easily used
    on any simple raylib-using project, with minimal adjustments and using
    the .zip extract technique for staging customizable working materials.

    The result will probably be rayVC and will assume that there is better
    proximity between the user src/, the wrk/ and app/ folders, after an
    unZip at a raylib-adjacent folder.

MANIFEST

    rawVC.txt
        this manifest and job-jar file

    core_basic_window.c
        the sample file from raylib for confirming script operation

    build-windows.bat
        the raylib file that will be torn down and maybe built back up

    rayLabRaylib.opt
        The options, search pathes, and code locations employed in making
        the raylib application.

    rayLabBuild.opt
        CL customizable command options file for the rayLab Build

    rayLabSources.opt
        CL customizable command options for the files to be built/included

    wrk/
        customizable folder for intermediate materials, parameters, etc.

    app/
        folder for the compiled .exe and also any resources that are
        expected local to the executable

TODO

  * Figure out how to build and exercise the raylib examples using a couple
    of WinCon-like build setups.

  * We need to sneak up on this.  Start with simple cases and refine what
    works as we go.

  * The editable .opt files are ways to have them be under source-control,
    be make dependencies, and also have them be more understandable.  The
    ones used should be customizable outside of a clone though.  Think more.

  * Initially, just build everything, needed or not.  This will be find for
    compiling examples.  The use of a clean option is valuable.

  * The resources folder needs to be in the app folder. That might be sketchy.

  * Need to deal with license combinations.  E.g., the raylib dependency and
    license, and the license here.  That's normally handled with a NOTICE and
    maybe that should be the case here.  These executables using raylib
    examples are clearly all raylib licensed.  If I contribute any new script,
    it will be under the raylib license and not have any others.  Watch it.

  * The wrk/ folder might need its own clean script?

  * I guess these are rayLab options command files.  Maybe that's not quite
    it, or we can presume someone would know how to rename them for other
    cases.

  * I am going to be righteous about not doing debugging builds.  There is
    only one build and it is the one that "ships."  So if there is logging and
    other provisions (e.g., symbols), they come along for the ride.  The idea
    is not to have such a crutch in early learning.  Confirmable experience
    and the ability to analyze is what I want to cultivate.  The /w option
    is also a problem, although it might be necessary with regard to building
    the raylib *.c files.  I am hating exposing beginners to this.

  * I want to keep the scripts and options at the level above app and tmp.
    I am beginning to think having them in wrk/ is appropriate when thinking
    about these being kits.

  * I think there might be another option file, and a couple of batch files.

  * I have surrendered to the need to compile the raylib files with /w.  For
    the specific files, /w3 and /sdl are used to get non-trivial warnings.

  * Now that build-windows.bat works and is boiled down to essentials,
    start taking things apart to get a repeatable case with a simpler set
    of operations using @*.opt files.

  * Start assuming a src/ folder and compile everything in it.  This will
    need to be covered by an /I inclusion too.

  * Start putting the source .objs in the wrk/ folder too.  This should be
    independent of naming the app.

  * Confirm that environment variables in *.opt files are not expanded and
    figure out a work-around.
