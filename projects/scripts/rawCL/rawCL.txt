            EXPLORATION OF RAYLAB USAGE IN NATIVE WINDOWS APPS

                      RAWCL BARE-BONES CL COMPILE SETUP
                      ---------------------------------

    The raylib/projects/scripts/rawCL folder is for a tear-down of the raylib
    build-windows.bat to a minimum case that works in a Command Prompt
    command-line environment that is already established.

    Operation is confirmed and the skeletal arrangement is employed with
    some simple example cases.

MANIFEST

    rawCL.txt
        this manifest and job-jar file

    core_basic_window.c
        the sample file from raylib for confirming script operation

    build-windows.bat
        the raylib file that will be torn down and maybe built back up

TODO

  * Replicate the build-windows.bat case that worked already and that
    shows the different *.obs produced as fixed static components.

  * Figure out how to build and exercise the raylib examples using a couple
    of WinCon-like build setups.

  * Determine whether there is a way that inserting projects into a working
    copy of raylib or in a shadow structure can work the same regardless.
    This tends to mean that relative links into raylib for includes and
    other artifacts will work properly.

  * We don't want the .obj files and other intermediates in the same location
    as the compiled .exe.  We want the .exe be in a folder of its own along
    with any copied resources.

  * We need to sneak up on this.  Start with simple cases and refine what
    works as we go.
