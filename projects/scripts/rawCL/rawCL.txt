            EXPLORATION OF RAYLAB USAGE IN NATIVE WINDOWS APPS

                      RAWCL BARE-BONES CL COMPILE SETUP
                      ---------------------------------

    The raylib/projects/scripts/rawCL folder is for a tear-down of the raylib
    build-windows.bat to a minimum case that works in a Command Prompt
    command-line environment that is already established.

    Operation is confirmed and the skeletal arrangement is employed with
    some simple example cases.

MANIFEST

    rawCL.txt
        this manifest and job-jar file

    core_basic_window.c
        the sample file from raylib for confirming script operation

    build-windows.bat
        the raylib file that will be torn down and maybe built back up

    rayLabBuild.opt
        CL customizable command options file for the rayLab Build

    rayLabSources.opt
        CL customizable command options for the files to be built/included

    temp/
        ignored folder for intermediate build materials

    app/
        folder for the compiled .exe and also any resources that are
        expected local to the executable

TODO

  * Replicate the build-windows.bat case that worked already and that
    shows the different *.obs produced as fixed static components.

  * Figure out how to build and exercise the raylib examples using a couple
    of WinCon-like build setups.

  * Determine whether there is a way that inserting projects into a working
    copy of raylib or in a shadow structure can work the same regardless.
    This tends to mean that relative links into raylib for includes and
    other artifacts will work properly.

  * We don't want the .obj files and other intermediates in the same location
    as the compiled .exe.  We want the .exe be in a folder of its own along
    with any copied resources.

  * We need to sneak up on this.  Start with simple cases and refine what
    works as we go.

  * The editable .opt files are ways to have them be under source-control,
    be make dependencies, and also have them be more understandable.

  * I don't know if the separate building of the raylib .obj files is worthy.
    Some of this has to do with the need to change directories and maybe there
    is a better way to deal with that.

  * Initially, just build everything, needed or not.  This will be find for
    compiling examples.

  * The resources folder needs to be in the app folder. That might be sketchy.

  * Need to deal with license combinations.  E.g., the raylib dependency and
    license, and the license here.  That's normally handled with a NOTICE and
    maybe that should be the case here.  These executables using raylib
    examples are clearly all raylib licensed.  If I contribute any new script,
    it will be under the raylib license and not have any others.  Watch it.

  * The app folder needs to hold some things about what it is about.  Ditto
    for the temp folder.  It might have its own clean script?

  * I guess they are rayLab options command files.  Maybe that's not quite it,
    or we can presume someone would know how to rename them for other cases.

  * I am going to be righteous about not doing debugging builds.  There is
    only one build and it is the one that "ships."  So if there is logging and
    other provisions (e.g., symbols), they come along for the ride.  The idea
    is not to have such a crutch in early learning.  Confirmable experience
    and the ability to analyze is what I want to cultivate.
