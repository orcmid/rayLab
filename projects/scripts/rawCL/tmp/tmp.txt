            EXPLORATION OF RAYLAB USAGE IN NATIVE WINDOWS APPS

                        RAWCL BARE-BONES TMP FOLDER
                        ---------------------------

    The raylib/projects/scripts/rawCL/tmp/ folder is a standard subfolder for
    a command-line build in the parent (e.g., rawCL) folder.  tmp/ has only
    two permanent contents.  This tmp.txt file and a gitignore that that keeps
    all other files excluded from a git repository.

    The folder will contain intermediate results of compile activities.  These
    are not required after the build and can easily be reconstructed in a
    subsequent build.

MANIFEST

    tmp.txt
        this manifest and job-jar file
    .gitignore
        excluding compilation intermediates from any git repository

TODO

  * If compiling is done here, the question is whether the option files can
    be accessed at rawCL from down here.  And then what are relative links
    determined from.

  * We need VC Toolcraft (in nfoTools) on CL.exe and especially the options
    files and how things like batch/environment variables and relative links
    are resolved.

  * Maybe options need to be copied or unzipped to tmp/ to have their
    customization ignored.  This doesn't quite make sense for rayLab; but it
    is a devKit case if contributed to raylib.  Hmm.

  * Juggle having the least that could possibly work here.

  * It makes sense to call this folder wrk/ rather than /tmp the way things
    going.
