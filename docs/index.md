# rayLab: Native Windows raylib Laboratory

## Synopsis

GitHub project `orcmid/rayLab` is a laboratory for experimental adaptation of
GitHub [raysan5/raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) libraries for
native Windows desktop PC applications, especially graphical games.

Freely-available tools are featured:

* git and gitHub for backup and change management
* Microsoft Visual Studio Build Tools for compiling, testing, and deploying
* Microsoft Visual Studio Code for editing and integrated operation

Development performed on Windows 10/11 desktop PCs with
results targetted for the same platforms, potentially distributed via the
Windows Store.  The critical characteristic is reliance on raylib for all
graphical functions.

rayLab shadows GitHub project `raysan5/raylib`, mimicking that structure
in the location of lab experiments.  Experimental customizations and
expansions of raylib materials are at corresponding shadow locations.  Any
contributions back to raylib happens via a
[raylib fork](https://github.com/orcmid/raylib).

## Laboratory Notebook

A variety of experiments are catalogued in a web counterpart of a laboratory
notebook.  The [folder of those notes](experiments), including a catalog
into them, is part of this web site.
