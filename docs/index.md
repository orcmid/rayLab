# rayLab: Native Windows raylib Laboratory

GitHub project [orcmid/rayLab](https://github.com/orcmid/rayLab) is a
laboratory for experimental application of GitHub project
[raysan5/raylib](https://github.com/raysan5/raylib) libraries in native
Windows desktop PC applications, especially graphical games.

RayLab teases out an on-ramp for introduction of beginners and casual
developers to the development of PC-based video games. Newcomers should
find this useful preparation for going further in available on-line courses,
community projects, and formal courses of study.

All programming work is in Clean C, a subset common to C and C++ (C/C++)
languages for straightforward programming without dependence on elaborate
features of C++.  The amount of novelty that a beginner must grasp at once
is minimized by sticking to fundamentals of this useful family of languages.
Clean C is an appropriate starter for evolving toward C++ fluency.

## Prerequisites

The working language is English(-us) and some fluency is required in working
with these materials and communicating with the rayLab and raylib projects.

Required tools are freely-available at no cost:

* Git and GitHub, a recommended option for backup and change management
* Microsoft Visual Studio Build Tools for compiling, testing, and deploying
* Microsoft Visual Studio Code for editing and integrated operation

Participants are expected to have familiarity and fluency in use of
the Microsoft Windows desktop, its File Explorer, a web browser, and PC
keyboard and mouse (or touchpad) operation.  Safe downloading and
installation of software is also important, along with Internet connectivity.

Making informative screen captures is important for sharing experiences and
reporting difficulties

Emphasis on reproducibility and confirmation of experiences,
along with keeping notes and backups of work might seem tedious.  These are
the ounces of prevention that will pay invaluable rewards as proficiency,
especially the abilities to troubleshoot and recover, is achieved.  Patience
is a prerequisite along with willingness to learn by trial-and-error.

## Development On and For Windows

RayLab features development on Windows 10/11 desktop PCs with
results targetted for the same platforms, potentially distributable via the
Windows Store.  The critical characteristic is reliance on raylib for all
graphical functions and user interactions.

rayLab's GitHub project `orcmid/rayLab`, mimics the structure of GitHub
project `raysan5/raylib` for locating experiments and demonstrations.
Any contributions back to raylib are introduced separately via the GitHub
[orcmid/raylib fork](https://github.com/orcmid/raylib).  That will become
more apparent as experimental confirmations are fleshed out.

## Laboratory Notebook

Experimental activities are catalogued in a web counterpart of laboratory
notebook.  The [`experiments` folder of those notes](experiments), including
a catalog into them, is part of this web site.  These are experiments for
establishing and confirming rayLab-derived setups.
