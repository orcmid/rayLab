# Experiment X210801: Screen Capture Quality Degradation

## Summary

The GitHub site presents down-sampled (degraded) versions of image files
when they are viewed in "`<> Code`".  The limitation extends to image files
incorporated in rendered Markdown files, such as `README.md` in "`<> Code`".

## Mitigation

Make certain that browser "Zoom" is set to 100% or larger.  The observed
degradation was with Microsoft Edge set to view browsed content at 80%.
