            X210802: INSTALLING RAYLIB INSIDE WINDOWS PROJECTS
            --------------------------------------------------

    The practice of having copies of raylib held inside projects that use the
    library is demonstrated.  The practice makes raylib version dependency
    clear and reproducible.  It also allows the dependencies between the
    project build operations and the location of raylib materials to be
    consistently relative from inside the location of the project when raylib
    is updated and when multiple projects are created using the same
    technique.

    The setup is intended to be workable by novices whether or not they are
    relying on Git[Hub] for source-code management and change control.

TODOS

 * Demonstrate downloading of a specific stable raylib release.

 * Address downloading of the latest under-development version if asked to
   confirm whether an issue remains present or not.  There are advanced
   conditions for this, since breaking changes may show up apart from the
   issue of concern.  Workarounds then matter.

 * Determine what works to have a clone in place of a Zip extraction.  I am
   thinking this is simply a bad idea.  One could do it if set up to keep
   testing with builds of an in-progress raylib, but maybe that becomes into
   a separate clone of ones own repo to see how to version.  Or maybe this is
   done with branching to keep a project aligned with developments on raylib.
   This takes more thought.

  * Proof-read X210802a with an eye to beginner's mind.

  * Remember to credit the idea of installing raylib inside a project to
    seeing that promoted by @JeffM2501 (Jeffery Myers).

  * Need to work in an explanation of the use of the Apache license and having
    it apply here as essentially CCbye with specified attributions.

  * Need to incorporate the raylib licenses at some point in NOTICE and also
    in textual references/mentions.

  * Which version and touching is recorded in the experiments/ catalog?  It
    is probably the most accurate to use this note's versioning, although
    that is not visible in the HTML files.  This is touched the most though.
