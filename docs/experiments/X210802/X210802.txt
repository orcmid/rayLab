            X210802: INSTALLING RAYLIB INSIDE WINDOWS PROJECTS
            --------------------------------------------------

    The practice of having copies of raylib held inside projects that use the
    library is demonstrated.  The practice makes raylib version dependency
    clear and reproducible.  It also allows the dependencies between the
    projects build operations and the location of raylib materials to be
    entirely relative inside the location of the project being developed.

TODOS

 * Capture a .gitignore that avoids preservation of the expanded raylib
   folder, since it is unchanging and should not be preserved as part of
   the containing project.

 * Demonstrate downloading of a specific stable raylib release.

 * Address downloading of the latest under-development version if asked to
   confirm whether an issue remains present or not.  There are advanced
   conditions for this, since breaking changes may show up apart from the
   issue of concern.  Workarounds then matter.

 * Show how to extract the raylib/ folder alongside the downloaded .zip
   file.  See if that can be done by dragging from the opened Zip.

 * Otherwise, show the alternative.

 * Determine what works to have a clone in place of a Zip extraction.
